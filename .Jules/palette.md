## 2023-11-20 - [ARIA Attributes and Forms Labels]
**Learning:** Found multiple instances where labels were disconnected from input fields because `htmlFor` and `id` were missing, especially in date inputs. Found icon-only buttons (like settings and close modal) lacking `aria-label`.
**Action:** When adding new input fields, always link labels via `htmlFor` to the input `id`. When creating buttons without text, always add an `aria-label`.

## 2026-04-01 - [Keyboard Navigation Focus States]
**Learning:** Found widespread absence of explicit `focus-visible` states across all interactive elements (buttons, inputs). Navigating via keyboard currently leaves users unaware of which element is focused.
**Action:** Always include keyboard focus indicators using the standard utility combination `focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-primary` for elements (with `focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:ring-offset-background` if needed against complex backgrounds).

## 2025-02-28 - [Escape Key Exit in Custom Modals]
**Learning:** Custom modal components often overlook the standard expected behavior of allowing users to dismiss them via the `Escape` key, trapping keyboard users or forcing mouse interaction.
**Action:** Whenever implementing a custom modal or overlay, always add a window-level keydown event listener to handle the `Escape` key and trigger the component's close function.## 2026-04-05 - [ARIA Attributes for Toggles and Navigation]
**Learning:** Found instances where custom toggle buttons (like language selection or segmented controls in tarot screen) and navigation links were missing programmatic indicators of their active state, leaving screen reader users without crucial context.
**Action:** Always use `aria-pressed={isActive}` for custom toggle buttons and segmented controls, and `aria-current="page"` for active navigation links to ensure their state is communicated to assistive technologies.
