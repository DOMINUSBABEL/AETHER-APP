## 2023-11-20 - [ARIA Attributes and Forms Labels]
**Learning:** Found multiple instances where labels were disconnected from input fields because `htmlFor` and `id` were missing, especially in date inputs. Found icon-only buttons (like settings and close modal) lacking `aria-label`.
**Action:** When adding new input fields, always link labels via `htmlFor` to the input `id`. When creating buttons without text, always add an `aria-label`.

## 2026-04-01 - [Keyboard Navigation Focus States]
**Learning:** Found widespread absence of explicit `focus-visible` states across all interactive elements (buttons, inputs). Navigating via keyboard currently leaves users unaware of which element is focused.
**Action:** Always include keyboard focus indicators using the standard utility combination `focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-primary` for elements (with `focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:ring-offset-background` if needed against complex backgrounds).

## 2025-02-28 - [Escape Key Exit in Custom Modals]
**Learning:** Custom modal components often overlook the standard expected behavior of allowing users to dismiss them via the `Escape` key, trapping keyboard users or forcing mouse interaction.
**Action:** Whenever implementing a custom modal or overlay, always add a window-level keydown event listener to handle the `Escape` key and trigger the component's close function.
## 2024-04-03 - [State and Context ARIA Properties]
**Learning:** This app heavily relies on custom UI components like segment toggles and decorative lists that lack native semantic meaning. Sighted users infer state through color shifts, but screen readers are left blind without explicit ARIA states.
**Action:** When building custom toggles, navigation items, or decorative visual sets in this system, always supplement with `aria-pressed`, `aria-current="page"`, and `aria-hidden="true"` respectively.
