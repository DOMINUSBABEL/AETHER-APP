## 2023-11-20 - [ARIA Attributes and Forms Labels]
**Learning:** Found multiple instances where labels were disconnected from input fields because `htmlFor` and `id` were missing, especially in date inputs. Found icon-only buttons (like settings and close modal) lacking `aria-label`.
**Action:** When adding new input fields, always link labels via `htmlFor` to the input `id`. When creating buttons without text, always add an `aria-label`.

## 2026-04-01 - [Keyboard Navigation Focus States]
**Learning:** Found widespread absence of explicit `focus-visible` states across all interactive elements (buttons, inputs). Navigating via keyboard currently leaves users unaware of which element is focused.
**Action:** Always include keyboard focus indicators using the standard utility combination `focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-primary` for elements (with `focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:ring-offset-background` if needed against complex backgrounds).

## 2025-02-28 - [Escape Key Exit in Custom Modals]
**Learning:** Custom modal components often overlook the standard expected behavior of allowing users to dismiss them via the `Escape` key, trapping keyboard users or forcing mouse interaction.
**Action:** Whenever implementing a custom modal or overlay, always add a window-level keydown event listener to handle the `Escape` key and trigger the component's close function.## 2023-11-20 - [ARIA Pressed states on Toggles]\n**Learning:** Found several instances of custom segmented controls and toggle buttons (language selection, deck selection, spread type) that visually indicated active state via classes but lacked semantic ARIA attributes, leaving screen reader users unaware of the selected option.\n**Action:** Always add `aria-pressed={isActive}` to custom toggle buttons or segmented control options to ensure their active state is properly communicated to assistive technologies.

## 2025-10-24 - [Accessible Horizontally Scrollable Selectors]
**Learning:** Found horizontally scrollable visual selectors (like the Zodiac selector) that visually indicate an active state but lack keyboard access and semantic meaning for screen readers.
**Action:** When creating custom horizontally scrollable selectors, apply `tabIndex={0}` to the container along with `focus-visible` utility classes for keyboard accessibility. Use explicit semantic roles (`role="list"` and `role="listitem"`) and indicate the active option using `aria-current="true"`.
